NodeChat
========
* Currently using large chunks of code from: https://github.com/DanialK/ReactJS-Realtime-Chat (unfortunately, there is no license provided so we are mentioning it in the README for now)
* Support multiple rooms

To decide
=========
* Login and Usernames: Facebook Login only/multiple social networks/custom username?
* Everyone could create a room / Only admins/mods can crate a room
* Keep history of the messages
* Database storage (Redis/storage API like Parse?)
